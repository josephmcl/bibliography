  Abstract = {This paper describes the development of an highly 
    efficient parallel multiblock structured code for aerodynamic 
    applications. The goal of our research is to assess whether or not 
    high-order energy stable schemes are more efficient for such 
    problems. The spatial part of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes 
    equations are solved making use of high-order energy stable 
    discretization techniques based on Summation By Parts (SBP) finite 
    difference operators and Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) 
    boundary treatment [1, 2, 3, 4]. The SBP/SAT schemes we employ are 
    up to 5th order accurate. The solver is conservative, implicit and 
    fully coupled with a modified version of the Spalart-Allmaras 
    turbulence model[5]. Thanks to the energy stability property of 
    the SBP/SAT schemes, a significantly reduced amount of artificial 
    dissipation is needed compared to schemes which do not posses this 
    (or a similar) property. As it will be shown in the results, this 
    leads to an higher accuracy of the numerical solutions.}}

    Abstract = {This dissertation outlines the development of a 
        parallel 3D hybrid finite-volume- finite-difference solver. As 
        motivation for such a scheme, the specific application area 
        under consideration is modeling the trailing vortices shed from 
        the wings of aircraft under transonic flight conditions. For 
        this purpose, the Elemental® finite volume code is employed in 
        the vicinity of the aircraft, while the Essense finite 
        difference software is employed to accurately resolve the 
        trailing vortices. The former method is spatially formally 
        2nd order and the latter set to 6th order accurate. The 
        coupling of the two methods is achieved in a stable manner 
        through the use of Summation-by-Parts operators and weak 
        imposition of boundary conditions through 
        Simultaneous-Approximation-Terms (SBP-SAT). Accordingly, a 
        special parallel SBP-SAT interface library is developed in 
        Elemental®. In addition, the code is extended to impose 
        boundary conditions in a weak manner via the SBP-SAT framework; 
        as well as interface volume definitions changed to allow 
        coupling with the 6th order code. The developed hybrid solver 
        is successfully validated against analytical test-cases. This 
        is followed by demonstrating its ability to model the flow 
        field, including trailing vortex structures, around the NASA Common-Research-Model (CRM) under transonic flow conditions. 
        Inviscid flow was assumed and the trailing vortices from both 
        wing and horizontal stabiliser accurately resolved to 3 and 1 
        reference chords downstream of the lifting surface 
        respectively. The robustness of the interface treatment is 
        demonstrated by the smoothness of the flow solution across an 
        interface boundary in the presence of high flow gradients and 
        rapidly changing mesh topology. In addition, high vortex axial 
        flow gradients were predicted while the vortex core speed is 
        6% slower than free-stream.}}
