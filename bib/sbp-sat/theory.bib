    Abstract = {A detailed account of the stability and accuracy 
        properties of the SBP-SAT technique for numerical time 
        integration is presented. We show how the technique can be 
        used to formulate both global and multi-stage methods with 
        high order of accuracy for both stiff and non-stiff problems. 
        Linear and non-linear stability results, including 
        A-stability, L-stability and B-stability are proven using the 
        energy method for general initial value problems. Numerical 
        experiments corroborate the theoretical properties.}}

        difference methods on summation-by-parts form with weak 
        boundary conditions, and extend that technique to the 
        time-domain. The new time-integration method is global, 
        high order accurate, unconditionally stable and together with 
        the approximation in space, it generates optimally sharp fully 
        discrete energy estimates. In particular, it is shown how 
        stable fully discrete high order accurate approximations of the 
        Maxwells’ equations, the elastic wave equations and the 
        linearized Euler and Navier–Stokes equations can obtained. Even 
        though we focus on finite difference approximations, we stress 
        that the methodology is completely general and suitable for all 
        semi-discrete energy-stable approximations. Numerical 
        experiments show that the new technique is very accurate and 
        has limited order reduction for stiff problems.}}

    Abstract = {High-order finite difference methods are efficient, 
        easy to program, scale well in multiple dimensions and can be 
        modified locally for various reasons (such as shock treatment 
        for example). The main drawback has been the complicated and 
        sometimes even mysterious stability treatment at boundaries and 
        interfaces required for a stable scheme. The research on 
        summation-by-parts operators and weak boundary conditions 
        during the last 20 years has removed this drawback and now 
        reached a mature state. It is now possible to construct stable 
        and high order accurate multi-block finite difference schemes 
        in a systematic building-block-like manner. In this paper we 
        will review this development, point out the main contributions 
        and speculate about the next lines of research in this area.}}

    Abstract = {Finite difference approximations for d/dx which satisfy 
        a summation by parts rule, have been evaluated, using different 
        types of norms, H, by implementation in the symbolic language 
        Maple. In the simpler diagonal norm, H = diag(λK;0, λ1, ..., 
        λ2τ - 1, 1, ...) with all λi positive, difference operators 
        accurate of order τ⩽4 at the boundary and accurate of order 2τ 
        in the interior have been evaluated. However, it was found that 
        the difference operators form multi-parameter families of 
        difference operators when τ⩾3. In the general full norm, 
        H = diag(H̃, I), with H̃ ∈ Rτ + 1 × τ + 1 being SPD, and I the 
        identity matrix, difference operators accurate or order 
        τ = 3, 5 at the boundary and accurate of order τ + 1 in the 
        interior have been computed. As in the diagonal norm case we 
        obtain a multiparameter family of operators when τ⩾3. Finally, 
        a three-parameter family of difference approximations with 
        accuracy three at and near the boundary and with accuracy four 
        in the interior have been computed using restricted full norms. 
        Here, H = diag(H̃ I), with H̃ ∈ Rτ + 2 × τ + 2 being SPD, and 
        H̃ (:, 1) = H̃ (1, :)τ = Ke1 , where K is a constant e1 is the 
        vector with the first element being one and the rest zero. 
        Regardless of which norm we use, the parameters can be 
        determined such that the bandwidth of the difference operators 
        are minimized. This is of interest when parallel computers are 
        used, since the bandwidth determines the memory requirement and 
        also the amount of computational work.}}
