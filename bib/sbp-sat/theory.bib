    Abstract = {A detailed account of the stability and accuracy 
        properties of the SBP-SAT technique for numerical time 
        integration is presented. We show how the technique can be 
        used to formulate both global and multi-stage methods with 
        high order of accuracy for both stiff and non-stiff problems. 
        Linear and non-linear stability results, including 
        A-stability, L-stability and B-stability are proven using the 
        energy method for general initial value problems. Numerical 
        experiments corroborate the theoretical properties.}}

    Abstract = {We develop a new high order accurate time-integration 
        technique for initial value problems. We focus on problems that 
        originate from a space approximation using high order finite 
        difference methods on summation-by-parts form with weak 
        boundary conditions, and extend that technique to the 
        time-domain. The new time-integration method is global, 
        high order accurate, unconditionally stable and together with 
        the approximation in space, it generates optimally sharp fully 
        discrete energy estimates. In particular, it is shown how 
        stable fully discrete high order accurate approximations of the 
        Maxwells’ equations, the elastic wave equations and the 
        linearized Euler and Navier–Stokes equations can obtained. Even 
        though we focus on finite difference approximations, we stress 
        that the methodology is completely general and suitable for all 
        semi-discrete energy-stable approximations. Numerical 
        experiments show that the new technique is very accurate and 
        has limited order reduction for stiff problems.}}
