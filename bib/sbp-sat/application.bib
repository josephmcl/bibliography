  Title = {Multigrid schemes for high order discretizations of 
    hyperbolic problems},
  Author = {Ruggiu, Andrea A and Nordstrom, Jan},
  Abstract = {Total variation diminishing multigrid methods have been 
    developed for first order accurate discretizations of hyperbolic 
    conservation laws. This technique is based on a so-called upwind 
    biased residual interpolation and allows for algorithms devoid of 
    spurious numerical oscillations in the transient phase. In this 
    paper, we justify the introduction of such prolongation and 
    restriction operators by rewriting the algorithm in a matrix-vector 
    notation. This perspective sheds new light on multigrid procedures 
    for hyperbolic problems and provides a direct extension for high 
    order accurate difference approximations. The new multigrid 
    procedure is presented, advantages and disadvantages are discussed 
    and numerical experiments are performed.},
