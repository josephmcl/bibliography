  Title = {Multigrid schemes for high order discretizations of 
    hyperbolic problems},
  Author = {Ruggiu, Andrea A and Nordstrom, Jan},
  Abstract = {Total variation diminishing multigrid methods have been 
    developed for first order accurate discretizations of hyperbolic 
    conservation laws. This technique is based on a so-called upwind 
    biased residual interpolation and allows for algorithms devoid of 
    spurious numerical oscillations in the transient phase. In this 
    paper, we justify the introduction of such prolongation and 
    restriction operators by rewriting the algorithm in a matrix-vector 
    notation. This perspective sheds new light on multigrid procedures 
    for hyperbolic problems and provides a direct extension for high 
    order accurate difference approximations. The new multigrid 
    procedure is presented, advantages and disadvantages are discussed 
    and numerical experiments are performed.},

    Abstract = {The influence of different boundary conditions on the 
        spectral properties of the incompressible Navier-Stokes 
        equations is investigated. By using the Fourier-Laplace 
        transform technique, we determine the spectra, extract the 
        decay rate in time, and investigate the dispersion relation. 
        In contrast to an infinite domain, where only diffusion affects 
        the convergence, we show that also the propagation speed 
        influence the rate of convergence to steady state for a bounded 
        domain. Once the continuous equations are analyzed, we 
        discretize using high-order finite-difference operators on 
        summation-by-parts form and demonstrate that the continuous 
        analysis carries over to the discrete setting. The theoretical 
        results are verified by numerical experiments, where we 
        highlight the necessity of high accuracy for a correct 
        description of time-dependent phenomena.}
