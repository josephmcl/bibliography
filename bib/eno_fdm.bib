        desirable properties with total variation diminishing schemes, 
        but TVD schemes have at most first order accuracy, in the 
        sense of truncation error, at extrema of the solution. In this 
        paper we construct a uniformly second order approximation,

        of the discrete solution is not increasing in time.},

    Abstract = {We continue the construction and the analysis of 
        essentially non- oscillatory shock capturing methods for the

        hierarchy of uniformly high-order accurate schemes which 
        generalizes Godunovâ€™s scheme and its second-order accurate 
        MUSCL extension to an arbitrary order of accuracy. The design 
        involves an essentially non-oscillatory piecewise polynomial 
        reconstruction of the solution from its cell averages, time 
        evolution through an approximate solution of the resulting 
        initial value problem, and averaging of this approximate 
        solution over each cell. The reconstruction algorithm is 
        derived from a new interpolation technique that, when applied 
        to piecewise smooth data, gives high-order accuracy whenever 
        the function is smooth but avoids a Gibbs phenomenon at 
        discontinuities. Unlike standard finite difference methods 
        this procedure uses an adaptive stencil of grid points and, 
        consequently, the resulting schemes are},

    Author = {In these lecture notes we describe the construction, 
        analysis, and application of ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory) 
        and WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) schemes for 
        hyperbolic con- servation laws and related Hamilton-Jacobi 
        equations. ENO and WENO schemes are high order accurate finite 
        difference schemes designed for problems with piecewise smooth 
        solutions containing discontinuities. The key idea lies at the approximation level, where a nonlinear adaptive procedure is 
        used to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, 
        hence avoiding crossing discontinuities in the interpolation 
        procedure as much as possible. ENO and WENO schemes have been 
        quite successful in applications, especially for problems 
        containing both shocks and complicated smooth solution 
        structures, such as compressible turbulence simulations 
        and aeroacoustics.
        These lecture notes are basically self-contained. It is our 
        hope that with these notes and with the help of the quoted 
        references, the reader can understand the algorithms and code 
        them up for applications. Sample codes are also available from

    Author = {Shu, Chi-Wang},
    Abstract = {Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted ENO 
        (WENO) schemes were designed for solving hyperbolic and 
        convection-diffusion equations with possibly discontinuous 
        solutions or solutions with sharp gradient regions. The main 
        idea of ENO and WENO schemes is actually an approximation 
        procedure, aimed at achieving arbitrarily high order accuracy 
        in smooth regions and resolving shocks or other discontinuities 
        sharply and in an essentially non-oscillatory fashion. Both 
        finite volume and finite difference schemes have been designed 
        using the ENO or WENO procedure, and these schemes are very 
        popular in applications, most noticeably in computational fluid 
        dynamics, but also in other areas of computational physics and 
        engineering. Since the main idea of the ENO and WENO schemes 
        is an approximation procedure not directly related to partial 
        differential equations (PDEs), ENO and WENO schemes also have 
        non-PDE applications. In this paper we will survey the basic 
        ideas behind ENO and WENO schemes, discuss their properties, 
        and present examples of their applications to different types 
        of PDEs as well as to non-PDE problems.},
