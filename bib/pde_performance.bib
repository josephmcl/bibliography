    Abstract = {Performance tests and analyses are critical to 
        effective high-performance computing software development and
        are central components in the design and implementation of
        computational algorithms for achieving faster simulations on 
        existing and future computing architectures for large-scale 
        application problems. In this article, we explore performance 
        and space-time trade-offs for important compute-intensive 
        kernels of large-scale numerical solvers for partial 
        differential equations (PDEs) that govern a wide range of 
        physical applications. We consider a sequence of PDE-motivated 
        bake-off problems designed to establish best practices for 
        efficient high-order simulations across a variety of codes and 
        platforms. We measure peak performance (degrees of freedom per 
        second) on a fixed number of nodes and identify effective code 
        optimization strategies for each architecture. In addition to 
        peak performance, we identify the minimum time to solution at 
        80% parallel efficiency. The performance analysis is based on 
        spectral and p-type finite elements but is equally applicable 
        to a broad spectrum of numerical PDE discretizations, including 
        finite difference, finite volume, and h-type finite elements.},
