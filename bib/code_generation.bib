    Abstract = {Numerical software for the solution of partial 
        differential equations is an important field in high 
        performance computing. We study software quality criteria for 
        such software using the Dune software framework as an example. 
        Given these software criteria, different development models are 
        discussed. We furthermore look at recent hardware developments 
        and how they affect software sustainability and 
        programmability. On this basis, we make a case for generative 
        programming techniques in the field of high performance 
        computing and go into detail about recent additions of such 
        into the Dune framework.},
