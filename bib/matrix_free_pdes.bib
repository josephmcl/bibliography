    Title = {Solving PDEs in Space-Time: 4D Tree-Based Adaptivity, 
        Mesh-Free and Matrix-Free Approaches},
    Abstract = {Numerically solving partial differential equations 
        (PDEs) remains a compelling application of supercomputing 
        resources. The next generation of computing resources - 
        exhibiting increased parallelism and deep memory hierarchies - 
        provide an opportunity to rethink how to solve PDEs, especially 
        time dependent PDEs. Here, we consider time as an additional 
        dimension and simultaneously solve for the unknown in large 
        blocks of time (i.e. in 4D space-time), instead of the 
        standard approach of sequential time-stepping. We discretize 
        the 4D space-time domain using a mesh-free kD tree 
        construction that enables good parallel performance as well as 
        on-the-fly construction of adaptive 4D meshes. To best use the 
        4D space-time mesh adaptivity, we invoke concepts from PDE 
        analysis to establish rigorous a posteriori error estimates 
        for a general class of PDEs. We solve canonical linear as well 
        as non-linear PDEs (heat diffusion, advection-diffusion, and 
        Allen-Cahn) in space-time, and illustrate the following 
        advantages: (a) sustained scaling behavior across a larger 
        processor count compared to sequential time-stepping 
        approaches, (b) the ability to capture "localized" behavior in 
        space and time using the adaptive space-time mesh, and (c) 
        removal of any time-stepping constraints like the 
        Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, as well as the 
        ability to utilize spatially varying time-steps. We believe 
        that the algorithmic and mathematical developments along with 
        efficient deployment on modern architectures shown in this 
        work constitute an important step towards improving the 
        scalability of PDE solvers on the next generation of 
        supercomputers.},

    Abstract = {A detailed account of the stability and accuracy 
        properties of the SBP-SAT technique for numerical time 
        integration is presented. We show how the technique can be 
        used to formulate both global and multi-stage methods with 
        high order of accuracy for both stiff and non-stiff problems. 
        Linear and non-linear stability results, including 
        A-stability, L-stability and B-stability are proven using the 
        energy method for general initial value problems. Numerical 
        experiments corroborate the theoretical properties.}}
