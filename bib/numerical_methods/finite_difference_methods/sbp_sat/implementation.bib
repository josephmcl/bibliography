    Abstract = {This paper describes the development of an highly 
        efficient parallel multiblock structured code for aerodynamic 
        applications. The goal of our research is to assess whether or 
        not high-order energy stable schemes are more efficient for 
        such problems. The spatial part of the Reynolds-Averaged 
        Navier-Stokes equations are solved making use of high-order 
        energy stable discretization techniques based on Summation By 
        Parts (SBP) finite difference operators and Simultaneous 
        Approximation Term (SAT) boundary treatment [1, 2, 3, 4]. The 
        SBP/SAT schemes we employ are up to 5th order accurate. The 
        solver is conservative, implicit and fully coupled with a 
        modified version of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model[5]. 
        Thanks to the energy stability property of the SBP/SAT schemes, 
        a significantly reduced amount of artificial dissipation is 
        needed compared to schemes which do not posses this (or a 
        similar) property. As it will be shown in the results, this 
        leads to an higher accuracy of the numerical solutions.}}

    School = {University of Cape Town},
    Note = {Abstract: This dissertation outlines the development of a 
        parallel 3D hybrid finite-volume- finite-difference solver. As 
        motivation for such a scheme, the specific application area 
        under consideration is modeling the trailing vortices shed from 
        the wings of aircraft under transonic flight conditions. For 
        this purpose, the Elemental® finite volume code is employed in 
        the vicinity of the aircraft, while the Essense finite 
        difference software is employed to accurately resolve the 
        trailing vortices. The former method is spatially formally 
        2nd order and the latter set to 6th order accurate. The 
        coupling of the two methods is achieved in a stable manner 
        through the use of Summation-by-Parts operators and weak 
        imposition of boundary conditions through 
        Simultaneous-Approximation-Terms (SBP-SAT). Accordingly, a 
        special parallel SBP-SAT interface library is developed in 
        Elemental®. In addition, the code is extended to impose 
        boundary conditions in a weak manner via the SBP-SAT framework; 
        as well as interface volume definitions changed to allow 
        coupling with the 6th order code. The developed hybrid solver 
        is successfully validated against analytical test-cases. This 
        is followed by demonstrating its ability to model the flow 
        field, including trailing vortex structures, around the NASA 
        Common-Research-Model (CRM) under transonic flow conditions. 
        Inviscid flow was assumed and the trailing vortices from both 
        wing and horizontal stabiliser accurately resolved to 3 and 1 
        reference chords downstream of the lifting surface 
        respectively. The robustness of the interface treatment is 
        demonstrated by the smoothness of the flow solution across an 
        interface boundary in the presence of high flow gradients and 
        rapidly changing mesh topology. In addition, high vortex axial 
        flow gradients were predicted while the vortex core speed is 
        6% slower than free-stream.}}

    Title = {A parallel Newton-Krylov-Schur flow solver for the 
        Navier-Stokes equations using the SBP-SAT approach},
    Abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional Newton-Krylov 
        flow solver for the Navier- Stokes equations which uses 
        summation-by-parts (SBP) operators on multi-block structured 
        grids. Simultaneous approximation terms (SAT’s) are used to 
        enforce the boundary conditions and the coupling of block 
        interfaces. The discrete equations are solved iteratively with 
        an inexact Newton method. The linear system of each Newton 
        iteration is solved using a Krylov subspace iterative method 
        with an approximate-Schur parallel preconditioner. The 
        algorithm is validated against an established two-dimensional 
        flow solver. Additionally, results are presented for laminar 
        flow around the ONERA M6 wing, as well as low Reynolds number 
        flow around a sphere. Using 384 processors, the solver is 
        capable of obtaining the steady-state solution (reducing the 
        flow residual by 12 orders of magnitude) on a 4.1 million node 
        grid around the ONERA M6 wing in 4.2 minutes. Convergence to 
        3 significant figures in force coefficients is achieved in 83 
        seconds. Parallel scaling tests show that the algorithm scales 
        well with the number of processors used. The results show that 
        the SBP-SAT discretization, solved with the parallel 
        Newton-Krylov-Schur algorithm, is an efficient option for three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions, with the SAT’s 
        providing several advantages in enforcing boundary conditions 
        and block coupling.},
