    Abstract = {Total variation diminishing multigrid methods have been 
        developed for first order accurate discretizations of 
        hyperbolic conservation laws. This technique is based on a 
        so-called upwind biased residual interpolation and allows for 
        algorithms devoid of spurious numerical oscillations in the 
        transient phase. In this paper, we justify the introduction of 
        such prolongation and restriction operators by rewriting the 
        algorithm in a matrix-vector notation. This perspective sheds 
        new light on multigrid procedures for hyperbolic problems and 
        provides a direct extension for high order accurate difference 
        approximations. The new multigrid procedure is presented, 
        advantages and disadvantages are discussed and numerical 
        experiments are performed.},

    Abstract = {The influence of different boundary conditions on the 
        spectral properties of the incompressible Navier-Stokes 
        equations is investigated. By using the Fourier-Laplace 
        transform technique, we determine the spectra, extract the 
        decay rate in time, and investigate the dispersion relation. 
        In contrast to an infinite domain, where only diffusion affects 
        the convergence, we show that also the propagation speed 
        influence the rate of convergence to steady state for a bounded 
        domain. Once the continuous equations are analyzed, we 
        discretize using high-order finite-difference operators on 
        summation-by-parts form and demonstrate that the continuous 
        analysis carries over to the discrete setting. The theoretical 
        results are verified by numerical experiments, where we 
        highlight the necessity of high accuracy for a correct 
        description of time-dependent phenomena.}}
