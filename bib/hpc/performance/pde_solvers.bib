    Abstract = {Performance tests and analyses are critical to 
        effective high-performance computing software development and
        are central components in the design and implementation of
        computational algorithms for achieving faster simulations on 
        existing and future computing architectures for large-scale 
        application problems. In this article, we explore performance 
        and space-time trade-offs for important compute-intensive 
        kernels of large-scale numerical solvers for partial 
        differential equations (PDEs) that govern a wide range of 
        physical applications. We consider a sequence of PDE-motivated 
        bake-off problems designed to establish best practices for 
        efficient high-order simulations across a variety of codes and 
        platforms. We measure peak performance (degrees of freedom per 
        second) on a fixed number of nodes and identify effective code 
        optimization strategies for each architecture. In addition to 
        peak performance, we identify the minimum time to solution at 
        80% parallel efficiency. The performance analysis is based on 
        spectral and p-type finite elements but is equally applicable 
        to a broad spectrum of numerical PDE discretizations, including 
        finite difference, finite volume, and h-type finite elements.},

    Abstract = {In this paper we present a new GPU-oriented mesh 
        optimization method based on high- order finite elements. Our 
        approach relies on node movement with fixed topology, through the 
        Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) and uses a global 
        nonlinear solve over the whole computational mesh, i.e., all mesh 
        nodes are moved together. A key property of the method is that 
        the mesh optimization process is recast in terms of finite 
        element operations, which allows us to utilize recent advances in 
        the field of GPU-accelerated high-order finite element 
        algorithms. For example, we reduce data motion by using tensor 
        factorization and matrix-free methods, which have superior 
        performance characteristics compared to traditional full finite 
        element matrix assembly and offer advantages for GPU-based HPC 
        hardware. We describe the major mathematical components of the 
        method along with their efficient GPU-oriented implementation. 
        In addition, we propose an easily reproducible mesh optimization 
        test that can serve as a performance benchmark for the mesh 
        optimization community.},

    Author = {Dobrev, Veselin and Knupp, Patrick and Kolev, Tzanio and 
        Mittal, Ketan and Tomov, Vladimir},
    Abstract = {We describe a framework for controlling and improving the 
        quality of high-order finite element meshes based on extensions 
        of the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) of [24]. This 
        approach allows high-order applications to have a very precise 
        control over local mesh quality, while still improving the mesh 
        globally. We address the adaption of various TMOP components to 
        the settings of general isoparametric element mappings, 
        including the mesh quality metric in 2D and 3D, the selection of 
        sample points and the solution of the resulting mesh optimization 
        problem. We also investigate additional practical concerns, such 
        as tangential relaxation and restricting the deviation from the 
        original mesh. The benefits of the new high-order TMOP algorithms 
        are illustrated on a number of test problems and examples from a 
        high-order arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) application [6]. 
        Our implementation is freely available in an open-source library 
        form [31].},
