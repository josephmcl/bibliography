    Abstract = {MFEM is an open-source, lightweight, flexible and 
        scalable C++ library for modular finite element methods that 
        features arbitrary high-order finite element meshes and spaces, 
        support for a wide variety of discretization approaches and 
        emphasis on usability, portability, and high-performance 
        computing efficiency. MFEM’s goal is to provide application 
        scientists with access to cutting-edge algorithms for 
        high-order finite element meshing, discretizations and linear 
        solvers, while enabling researchers to quickly and easily 
        develop and test new algorithms in very general, fully 
        unstructured, high-order, parallel and GPU-accelerated 
        settings. In this paper we describe the underlying algorithms 
        and finite element abstractions provided by MFEM, discuss the 
        software implementation, and illustrate various applications 
        of the library.}}

        and moving domains, high order discretizations and node level

    Title = {Thermal stress and reliability analysis of TSV-based 3-D 
        ICs with a novel adaptive strategy finite element method},
    Abstract = {Thermomechanical stress is one of the most important 
        issues in performance and reliability analysis of through 
        silicon via-based 3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs), where an 
        accurate numerical approach is generally needed to produce 
        stress models and identify weak points in the structure. In 
        this paper, we propose a knowledge-oriented nonuniform (KONU) 
        refinement strategy for 3-D IC stress simulation under the 
        framework of a parallel adaptive finite element method (FEM), 
        and apply it in 3-D IC stress and reliability analysis. 
        Parallel adaptive FEM is promising for solving large-scale 
        problems due to its high accuracy and parallel efficiency. It 
        produces refined meshes based on the a posteriori error 
        analysis, which has the quasi-optimal convergence rate for 
        solving the problem. It has high parallel efficiency, which 
        makes it suitable for handling large and complex structures 
        in 3-D ICs. The KONU refinement strategy developed in this 
        paper can efficiently reduce the number of refinement 
        iterations in parallel adaptive FEM for 3-D IC thermomechanical 
        stress simulation and improves the computational efficiency. 
        It is demonstrated in this paper through several examples that 
        parallel adaptive FEM for thermomechanical stress evaluation 
        can be widely applied in 3-D IC reliability analysis, where 
        accurate stress simulation and modeling is exceptionally 
        important to produce accurate results.},
