    Abstract = {MFEM is an open-source, lightweight, flexible and 
        scalable C++ library for modular finite element methods that 
        features arbitrary high-order finite element meshes and spaces, 
        support for a wide variety of discretization approaches and 
        emphasis on usability, portability, and high-performance 
        computing efficiency. MFEM’s goal is to provide application 
        scientists with access to cutting-edge algorithms for 
        high-order finite element meshing, discretizations and linear 
        solvers, while enabling researchers to quickly and easily 
        develop and test new algorithms in very general, fully 
        unstructured, high-order, parallel and GPU-accelerated 
        settings. In this paper we describe the underlying algorithms 
        and finite element abstractions provided by MFEM, discuss the 
        software implementation, and illustrate various applications 
        of the library.}}

        and the main papers describing that state Bastian etal. 
        (2008a, 2008b). This discussion is accompanied with a 
        description of various advanced features, such as coupling of 
        domains and cut cells, grid modifications such as adaptation 
        and moving domains, high order discretizations and node level 
        performance, non-smooth multigrid methods, and multiscale 
        methods. A brief discussion on current and future development 
        directions of the framework concludes the paper.}}
